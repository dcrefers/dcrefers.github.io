  <li>
    “User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.

  </li>
  <li>
    “Client Portals” are shared spaces that are part of our App Platform Services and that can be utilized by Users to make available User-Generated (1) apps solely for the purpose of Endusers running those apps and (2) database records that may contain information collected by apps as well as inputted by the User who operates the Client Portal.
  </li>
  <li>
    “Endusers” are parties whose information and inputs may be collected and processed by apps built by Users or via Client Portals that Users make available.

        </li>
        <li>
         Technical Failures: The app you purchased has a technical issue that makes it permanently unuseable. If the technical issue could have been discovered by the User who activated the app prior to activation (e.g., in Test Mode), the User who activated the app is not eligible for refund of the Marketplace Fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Duplicate Purchases: A User unintentionally purchases access to the same app or Community twice.
        </li>
      </ol>
